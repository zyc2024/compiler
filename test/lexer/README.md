# Lexer tests

## positive test cases

1. check all tokens can be produced
2. verify with different valid strings/character literals

## example programs

1. these programs are also positive test cases but are semantically valid as well

## negative test cases

1. each test case must end with an error line printed
2. the very first error is reported and lexing should stop
